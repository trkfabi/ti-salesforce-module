/**
 Window used for presenting a modal stack of view controllers over the host application.
 
 This can be used, for example, to present the Knowledge service interface.  Similarly, a separate window of this instance type may be constructed specifically for the Chat experience.  Separating these stacks into separate windows allows entire sets of controllers to be shown and hidden, or dismissed in bulk, without interfering with each other.
 
 The root view controller defaults to a special controller that defaults to be completely transparent, and passes touches down to lower windows.  Any modal view controller presented on top of this will have its transitioning delegate automatically applied from the SCServiceCloud instance.
