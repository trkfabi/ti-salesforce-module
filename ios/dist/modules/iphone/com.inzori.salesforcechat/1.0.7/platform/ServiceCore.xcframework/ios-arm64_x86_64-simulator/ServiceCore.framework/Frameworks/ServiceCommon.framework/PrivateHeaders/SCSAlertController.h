 Specialized UIAlertController subclass that presents into its own managed window, ensuring that it will always float over any other window or view controller.
 
 UIAlertController, unlike UIAlertView, presents as a view controller within its view hierarchy using a custom presentation controller.  This means you can't get an alert to float over other windows unless it is isolated in its own window.
