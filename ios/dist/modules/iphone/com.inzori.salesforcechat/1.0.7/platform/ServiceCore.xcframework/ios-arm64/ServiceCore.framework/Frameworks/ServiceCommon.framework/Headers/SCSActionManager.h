/**
 The SCSActionManager class controls the handling and display of the action buttons that are overlaid on the various Snap-ins SDK interface elements to allow the user to initiate various actions, such as:
 
 - Creating a new case.
 - Initiating a knowledge article search.
 - Starting a Live Agent chat session.
 - Initiating an SOS support session.
 
 These built-in actions are managed through the action manager class, and can be customized through the use of it and the associated protocols available.  Furthermore, the `SCSActionManagerDelegate` protocol can be used to interact with, and customize, the handling of these actions.
 
 Each action button that is displayed is represented by `UIView` instances that conform to the `SCSActionItem` protocol.  Each of these items are displayed within a `UIViewController` instance that conforms to the `SCSActionItemController` protocol.  Built-in defaults are provided that implement these behaviors, and can be used to extend or customize functionality.  Furthermore, the default action button is exposed as the `SCSActionButton` class, and can be used to introduce additional actions along side the built-in defaults, while still maintaining the same visual appearance.
