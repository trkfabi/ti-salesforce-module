 Protocol defining the interface available to consumers of relevant articles.  This controller can be returned by requesting a view controller using the `SCUServiceEventRelevantArticles` event.
 
 The following SCSEvent userInfo keys are supported

 - `sourceController` - The source controller that is requesting the accessory input.
 - `searchTerms` - An `NSSet<NSString*>` list of search terms to initialize the controller with.
 
 When returned it is assumed the view controller will be added as a child view controller of the parent.  It's important to note that the `inputAccessoryView` is meant to be used within the keyboard's `inputAccessoryView`, not the `view` itself.
