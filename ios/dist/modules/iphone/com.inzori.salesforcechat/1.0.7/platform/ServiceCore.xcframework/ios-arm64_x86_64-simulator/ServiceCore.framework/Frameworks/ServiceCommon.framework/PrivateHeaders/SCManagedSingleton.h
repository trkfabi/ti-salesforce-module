/**
 This protocol defines classes that should be managed as if it were a singleton, within a shared instance.
 
 The SCSingletonManager class functions as an abstract container to create instances of managed singletons on-demand.  It allows each of these classes to be stored in a common container so that access to these resources can be centralized through a common manager.
 
 The goal of this protocol is to allow public client access to these resources as a singleton, but private implementations can still treat the classes as retained resources, without the inherent risks involved in dealing with singletons.
