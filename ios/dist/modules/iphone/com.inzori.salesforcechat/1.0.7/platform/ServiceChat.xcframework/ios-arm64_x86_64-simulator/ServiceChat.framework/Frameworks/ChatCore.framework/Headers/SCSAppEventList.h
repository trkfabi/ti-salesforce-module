 The `SCSAppEventList` allows for matching specific schemes of URLs which may be received remotely.
 When a matching URL is detected it is removed from the original message, and results in a URL event which

 Matching will occur in the order that the descriptions are added. You should add patterns
 in order: from the most specific to the most generic.

 For example if you add ".*" as an expression first, that will always match all paths provided on this instance.
 Note: Expressions are given priority when returning an associated description. It is recommended to
 use either direct path matching, or regex matching. Not both.

 @param description The description for the associated URL.
 @param expression The regex expression which will be used to match against a provided url.
 The pattern must be a valid regex expression or it will be ignored.
